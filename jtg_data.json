            "main_description": "Responding to the needs of folks with chronically dry skin that tends toward sensitivity, or experiences stress from managing the impact of - for example - an arid climate, Just the Goods has developed a light cleansing gel that balances the need for both surface cleansing and moisutre retention.  And yes, sometimes and oil cleansing method just feels nice, too! This product can be used alone, or before the gentle exfoliation offered via petal, leaf, root. by Just the Goods' cleansing grains for dry skin. In either case, it is recommended that this product be followed with cleansing toner for best results.  This light gel features the following ingredients:  Organic, unrefined coconut oil -- while not recommended as a leave-on facial moisturizer -- contains a variety of medium-chain fatty acids with antibacterial and antifungal properties that help to break down sebum, dirt, and makeup on the surface of the skin without causing irritation.  Castor oil is a humectant rich in triglycerides to help skin retain moisture while also stimulating new tissue growth Jojoba oil is uniquely like our own skin's sebum, so it is remarkably effective at penetrating deeply to both deliver necessary moisture and control excess oil in every skin type. It also contains essential fatty acids such as omega-6 and -9, rich antioxidants, and nourishing vitamins A, D, and E, all of which combine to soothe, protect, and repair cellular damage. Geranium essential oil offering antiseptic, antifungal, and antibacterial properties help to normalize sebum secretion and prevent acne. As an anti-inflammatory, it promotes blood circulation ensuring best possible nourishment to cells, which contributes to hydration and minimizes incidences of eczema and rosacea. Rich in antioxidants, it promotes skin’s natural ability to ward off free radicals and harmful UV rays. It's gentle astringent effect helps to cleanse and tighten pores.  Bisabolol is the active compound in chamomile, which makes it anti-irritant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial -- all beneficial for gentle cleansing while also soothing and softening dry and/or easily irritated skin. This product is also suitable for daily use by those with normal/sensitive skin and suitable for occassional use by those with oily skin. This cleanser can remove both mineral and petroleum-based makeup. For best results, remove product from face with a washcloth well saturated with warm water, then  -- as mentioned above -- follow with an appropriate toner applied with a cotton pad to reach into pores for a complete finish.  Find JTG’s tips for daily skin care, including how to most effectively use toner, here: <a href=\"https://justthegoods.net/pages/tips-for-daily-skin-care\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://justthegoods.net/pages/tips-for-daily-skin-care</a>. Each glass jar contains 100 g / 3.52 oz. This product contains ingredients considered safe for use during most pregnancies and nursing.

            "main_description": "petal, leaf, root. by Just the Goods’ facial serum for dry skin combines fast absorbing oils to hydrate without residue while also delivering a rich variety of vitamins, essential fatty acids, and antioxidants to replenish and tone skin for soft texture and a healthy glow. Rosehip seed oil is harvested from the seeds of rose bushes and is full of antioxidants vitamins A and C, and omega-6 essential fatty acids, which nourish cells deeply to protect, repair, hydrate, and promote healthy cellular turnover thanks to boosted production of collagen and elastin. Chia seed oil is noted for being a rich botanical source of essential fatty acids that are powerfully anti-inflammatory to reduce, prevent, and treat itchy, dry skin even when associated with internal medical conditions, as opposed to the sorts of dryness triggered by living in an arid climate. And, in the course of fighting irritation and dehydration, chia seed oil can help to promote a clear complexion, as well. The gamma-linoleic acid among other nutrients found in evening primrose oil are essential for retaining cell structure and promoting the elasticity of skin. This and other fatty acids are anti-inflammatory in nature, which helps to reduce redness and irritation to prevent incidences of eczema and/or psoriasis. Being so highly moisturizing, evening primrose oil reduces dryness by encouraging healthy regeneration of skin cells for softer feeling skin Castor oil is a humectant rich in triglycerides to help skin retain moisture while also stimulating new tissue growth Neroli essential oil softens skin as mildly antibacterial properties help to clear pores while imparting moisture. And, since stress causes spikes in cortisol levels which can lead to breakouts due to hormonal imbalance (i.e. acne, psoriasis, eczema, etc), neroli’s aromatherapeutic value benefits the nervous system to reduce anxiety, and ultimately benefit skin health, as well. Helichrysum is very hydrating and is known to reduce the appearance of scars by promoting cellular turnover. In this way it may also help to reduce the impacts of UV damage. A little goes a long way! Experiment by adding only a few drops to the face, and adding as desired. Take an opportunity to deeply inhale the serum before applying to experience maximum aromatherapeutic benefit.

            "main_description": "After extensive research, I've concluded that conventional products marketed as eye cream take advantage of misinformation about what skin really needs by offering formulas that contain little more than petrochemicals designed to feel light and absorb quickly, which are then packaged into smaller containers and sold at a higher price.  Over the past 10 years, clients worldwide have expressed satisfaction using my facial moisturizer for normal/sensitive skin around the delicate eye area because it is made from nutritive, non-toxic, plant based ingredients and does not contain any essential oils which might cause eyes to water or burn. Some people feel comfortable using JTG's facial moisturizer for dry skin under more extreme conditions (i.e. very arid climates, or while managing specific skin or overall conditions). Please note, however, that I *never* recommend Just the Goods facial moisturizers for oily/combination skin or acne prone skin be used around the eyes because they contain essential oils that are inappropriate for use near the eyes.  Those with oily/combination skin or acne prone skin who purchase full-sized bottles of facial moisturizer for their needs opt to purchase a small/sample sized bottle of facial moisturizer for normal/sensitive skin to be used exclusively as eye cream.  If - at some point in the future - I decided to create a wholly new formula that genuinely serves people in a better way as an exclusively single function product, you can trust that I'll be completely transparent about it and *not* take advantage of the marketplace collusion that imagines tiny jars as overpriced miracles ;-) This product can be found in the listing for Just the Goods facial moisturizer for normal/sensitive skin, but I'm offering it here as its own listing to help folks find this information more quickly/easily. *** Please note that this item ships as a 1 oz bottle of facial moisturizer for normal/sensitive skin, which is exactly what it is (as described above). I have not created new/different labels. Your will not receive a 1 oz bottle that has a label for \"eye cream\". *** Ingredient highlights: Avocado oil is rich in vitamins A, D and E, as well as potassium, proteins, beta-carotene and numerous essential unsaturated fatty acids. It also contains a high quantity of sterolins, which is reported to help reduce age spots, help heal sun damage and scars. Avocado oil is furthermore said to increase the amount of collagen in the skin, which facilitates regeneration, particularly in the case of skin that is dehydrated or otherwise affected by difficult climates (i.e. Winnipeg’s dry winters). Some claim that avocado oil can even help to relieve the dryness and itching of psoriasis and eczema. Apricot kernel oil has a high content of vitamins A, C, and E, as well as fatty acids such as oleic and linoleic acid. It is considered gentle enough to be used in products for babies, and is thus also suitable for mature and sensitive skin. It is well absorbed without leaving a greasy feeling, and can be helpful in calming the discomfort associated with conditions such as eczema and dermatitis. Aloe vera gel is a powerful moisturizer that simultaneously helps to remove dead skin. It also stimulates the synthesis of collagen and elastin and is known to have a healing effect on burns and other wounds, all of which translates into assisting regeneration. This handcrafted product is made without artificial preservatives. To protect it's integrity and to promote longevity, please store this product in a cool dark place and seal tightly between uses as heat and sunlight will cause premature deterioration.",
            "Format": "This product -- facial moisturizer for normal/sensitive skin that doubles as eye cream -- is offered in 25 ml/1 oz hdpe bottles. Please note that the stock image shows a larger format of the same product (118 ml / 4 oz). A new photo of a smaller bottle will be uploaded when it becomes available. There is no product with a label stating \"eye cream\". Thanks!",
            "Note": "This item is made with the the same formula that also serves as: tattoo aftercare, after sun lotion, hair smoothing lotion, and as a general hand/body lotion idea for managing mild cases of eczema (unscented lotion with apricot kernel and avocado oil). These items are bottled with different names to better serve those looking for specific items. Customer feedback has also indicated that it helps to avoid confusion with the facial moisturizers for other skin types which contain ingredients unsuitable for other purposes  Facial moisturizer for normal/sensitive skin, however, can be used as an eye cream and is being offered as such. "

Jojoba oil is uniquely like our own skin's sebum, so it is remarkably effective at penetrating deeply to both deliver necessary moisture and control excess oil in every skin type. It also contains essential fatty acids such as omega-6 and -9, rich antioxidants, and nourishing vitamins A, D, and E, all of which combine to soothe, protect, and repair cellular damage. Rosehip seed oil is harvested from the seeds of rose bushes and is full of vitamins A and C, antioxidants, and omega-6 essential fatty acids, which nourish cells deeply to protect, repair, hydrate, and promote healthy cellular turnover thanks to boosted production of collagen and elastin.  Evening Primrose Oil contains a high concentration of a fatty acid called gamma-linolenic acid, which has been shown to reduce clogged pores by dissolving sebum and other impurities. The fatty acids in evening primrose oil are anti-inflammatory in nature, which helps to reduce redness and irritation.  A powerful, stimulating skin cleanser, niaouli is a more gentle version of tea tree oil with both antiseptic and antibacterial properties that can help to manage skin irritations and keep skin clear. It’s cicatrisant and vulnerary properties help to speed healing by encouraging new tissue growth, ultimately contributing to a smoother complexion via diminishing the appearance of scars from past acne, etc.  Neroli essential oil softens skin as mildly antibacterial properties help to clear pores while imparting moisture. And, since stress causes spikes in cortisol levels which can lead to breakouts due to hormonal imbalance (i.e. acne, psoriasis, eczema, etc), neroli’s aromatherapeutic value benefits the nervous system to reduce anxiety, and ultimately benefit skin health, as well. One of the world's most powerful astringents, yarrow can strengthen skin tone, balance sebum production, and reduce enlarged pores. And, thanks to its well balanced antiseptic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and emollient properties, it is furthermore known to treat and soothe infections, rashe and reducing redness.  A little goes a long way! Experiment by adding only a few drops to the face, and adding as desired. Take an opportunity to deeply inhale the serum before applying to experience maximum aromatherapeutic benefit.

As such, it can gently help to balance minor issues such as blackheads and pimples. Spirulina is high in protein, amino acids, calcium and iron, vitamin E, and other nutrients making it well regarded as a dietary supplement.

This product is extracted from the fruiting body of Chaga mushroom using both hot water and alcohol making it very soluble and thus readily available for absorption by skin. Chaga mushroom shows up as a sclerotia (concentrated growth) that is found mostly on birch trees in the northern regions of our planet. It has been used for at least several hundred years in Russia and Eastern Europe and is well known and used extensively by indigenous people of northern Canada, Europe and Siberia. As a superfood and medicine Chaga has gained much popularity over the last 10 years, mostly due to its heavily researched potential anti-tumor and immuno-modulating properties. Chaga is also employed as a potent antioxidant for which it is starting to get quite a reputation. Indeed, it is these antioxidants (primarily polyphenols, which are components of melanin and hispidin analogs, and superoxide dismutase and catalase) that help to reduce cellular damage while improving elasticity and potentially minimizing the effects of scarring. Naturally occurring betulonic acid and zinc help to regenerate skin cells to facilitate healing. And, it's anti-inflammatory properties are especially beneficial to skin prone to swelling and/or redness. All in all, a fantastic ingredient to help protect skin. This dual extracted powder blends easily with water for use as a mask. Use it alone or blended with a light clay to help draw impurities away from the skin.

French pink clay includes a rich concentration of minerals such as iron and calcite to gently draw impurities away from pores while offering light exfoliation when lightly massaged over skin While still being very gentle, rooibos tea contains high levels of antioxidants (including polyphenols, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, and superoxide dismutase), which protect cells against damage and help skin glow. It is also rich in essential minerals such as calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, potassium, and zinc, all of which nourish cells and promote regeneration and reduce incidences of issues such as eczema and/or psoriasis. Skullcap has been used for thousands of years to provide preventative care against skin conditions such as eczema, which are the result of irritated cells. It is presumed beneficial thanks to three most important antioxidants in skullcap: baicalein, oroxylin A, and wogonin, all of which protect cells by preventing inflammation and other damage, while also nurturing cellular regeneration Masks are best used after the face has been well cleaned; follow a mask with with toner to remove any residue that may be left behind after rinsing.

            "main_description": "Facial steams provide a range of benefits to skin. First, steam helps to open pores so they can release accumulated oil, dirt, and sebum that face wash alone can not. Next, they can impart valuable nutrients by releasing them from dry plant material allowing for ready absorption into skin. petal, leaf, root. by Just the Goods’ facial steam for normal/sensitive skin using 100% certified organic ingredients provides gentle support in ways that are cleansing, anti-inflammatory, and restorative. The anti-inflammatory properties of rose petals replenish skin, helping it feel soft by reducing redness and/or swelling while its mild antibacterial action helps to cleanse and tone pores. Rose is also high in Vitamin C, an antioxidant that helps prevent cellular damage.  Passion flower's antioxidant content helps protect skin against environmental stressors while it's high levels of vitamins A and C nourish skin keeping it firm and capable of regeneration. Passion flower's valuable omega-6 essential fatty acids manage sebum production to prevent dryness without clogging pores. And, since passion flower also helps to calm the mind, it can help to reduce stress, which also facilitates clear skin.  Calendula petals have been centuries to treat minor wounds, stings, rashes, and skin irritations such as chafing and dryness. Calendula is high in carotenoids, which are antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and immune stimulating.  This facial steam can be added to the herbal basket of a dedicated facial steaming appliance, or it can be prepared in a bowl of hot water.

            "main_description": "petal, leaf, root. by Just the Goods’ facial serum for normal/sensitive skin combines fast absorbing oils to hydrate without residue while also delivering a rich variety of vitamins, essential fatty acids, and antioxidants to replenish and tone skin for soft texture and a healthy glow. Jojoba oil is uniquely like our own skin's sebum, so it is remarkably effective at penetrating deeply to both deliver necessary moisture and control excess oil in every skin type. It also contains essential fatty acids such as omega-6 and -9, rich antioxidants, and nourishing vitamins A, D, and E, all of which combine to soothe, protect, and repair cellular damage. Rosehip seed oil is harvested from the seeds of rose bushes and is full of vitamins A and C, antioxidants, and omega-6 essential fatty acids, which nourish cells deeply to protect, repair, hydrate, and promote healthy cellular turnover thanks to boosted production of collagen and elastin.  Rich in palmistic and omega-6 Linoleic fatty acids (among others), as well as cell protecting polyphenol antioxidants, camellia seed oil not only nourishes skin to promote elasticity, but calms inflammation as it delivers non-greasy smoothing moisture without residue  Neroli essential oil softens skin as mildly antibacterial properties help to clear pores while imparting moisture. And, since stress causes spikes in cortisol levels which can lead to breakouts due to hormonal imbalance (i.e. acne, psoriasis, eczema, etc), neroli’s aromatherapeutic value benefits the nervous system to reduce anxiety, and ultimately benefit skin health, as well.  Geranium essential oil offers antiseptic, antifungal, and antibacterial properties help to normalize sebum secretion and prevent acne. As an anti-inflammatory, it promotes blood circulation ensuring best possible nourishment to cells, which contributes to hydration and minimize incidences of eczema and rosacea. Rich in antioxidants, it promotes skin’s natural ability to ward off free radicals and harmful UV rays. It's gentle astringent effect on skin helps to control excess oil, as well as cleanse and tighten pores.  Extracted from Boswellia sacra tree, frankincense essential oil has long been valued for its gentle antibacterial and astringent properties, which can help clear and tighten pores while it's pentacyclic triterpene structure helps to soothe irritated skin. Considered a useful aromatherapeutic oil for managing stress and anxiety, frankincense can also benefit skin by supporting the nervous system to reduce the impact of stress-related hormonal imbalances such as inflammation and acne.  A little goes a long way! Experiment by adding only a few drops to the face, and adding as desired. Take an opportunity to deeply inhale the serum before applying to experience maximum aromatherapeutic benefit.

            "main_description": "Make summer last forever with this limited edition strawberry face mask! In the past when I offered this mask, I used strawberries organically grown in my partner's greenhouse. This year (like last year) our schedules were too packed and didn't allow time to garden, so I bought organic ones to make sure this could still happen. This year's formula, like last year's, features strawberries and clay without any other botanicals to ensure the blend is as accessible as possible for all skin types =-) Kaolin is a mild yet effective clay suitable for all skin types selected for its ability to absorb accumulated oil and dirt from pores without over-drying Pink clay includes a higher concentration of minerals such as iron and calcite to provide a little more draw as well as exfoliating benefits Organic strawberries are high in vitamin c making them mildly astringent and thus helpful in revitalizing dull skin while slight acidity helps release excess sebum This preservative-free product lasts longer when exposure to the elements (i.e. air, humidity, sunlight) is kept to a minimum. Please store in a cool, dark place and keep tightly sealed between uses. Please note, this limited edition product is not offered in sample sizes because it is a high demand item and I want to ensure I have enough available for everyone who has been waiting patiently all year for it to be released once again.

            "main_description": "For those with oily and easily congested skin -- a type prone to blackheads, impacted sebaceous glands/sebaceous cysts, and acne -- the value of a nutritive facial steam to open and gently cleanse pores can not be overstated. Used after washing, it can help to make toner more effective; used before a face mask, it can help clay reach deeper to pull out unwanted elements such as bacteria, sebum, sweat, and makeup. Facial steaming can also prolong the the duration of a mask making it possible to derive maximum benefit.  Soothing, aromatherapy is also a positive benefit turning home skin care into a spa-like experience.  organic parsley helps balance sebum production while also providing antibacterial and anti-fungal protection, making it helpful for treating acne among other minor skin infections. It is also high in antioxidants, which can help reduce the amount of free radicals which can be responsible for skin damage. High in Vitamin C, parsley helps to stimulate collagen production and ultimately the renewal of skin cells overall.  Organic lavender offers anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties that can reduce incidences of acne and inflammation. Lavender features antioxidants that can temper the effects of pollutants on skin by boosting the renewal process. And, by adding moisture, it can help to relieve itching as well as reduce the symptoms associated with excessive dryness such as eczema.  Juniper berries, like parsley, can help balance sebum production, which contributes to clear, matte skin. High in flavonoids and antioxidants, it can to resist damage to skin by free radicals. And, in dried berry form, not a concentrated essential oil, it offers mild antibacterial and antimicrobial support for skin while also offering uplifting aromatherapeutic benefits.  This product is not recommended for sensitive skin.

            "main_description": "Did you know that the most common skin type in the world is oily? That's right! So, in a sense, it should actually be the skin type known as \"normal\", *lol* While it is the most common, it can also be the most frustrating to maintain because excess sebum production in skin can contribute to clogged pores, which in turn leads to blackheads, impacted sebaceous glands/sebaceous cysts, and acne. This mask is designed to help; weekly use is recommended. Licorice root powder contains licochalcone, which helps to regulate the skin's oil production to calm over-active glands. It also contains glycyrrhizin, a helpful anti-inflammatory, and glabridin, which is believed to benefit the connective tissue of skin. High in antioxidants, liquorice can fight skin-damaging free radicals. Well blended with clay, the licorice scent is barely noticeable when dry, and only very faintly when wet. So, if you're not a fan of licorice flavour, feel confident that this is not the same. Samples in limited availability made from batch ends are available to try; select them using the drop down menu.  Australian olive green clay, packed with a wide array of minerals, is the strongest of all clays used in facial care restoring balance to acne-prone and oily skin through the absorption of dirt and oil. Some say it is revitalizing enough to help reduce the appearance of scars.  Kaolin is a mild yet effective clay suitable for all skin types selected for its ability to absorb accumulated oil and dirt from pores without over-drying and has been included to mediate the green clay.  This product is best suited for oily and congested skin types. This product is not recommended for sensitive skin.  This preservative-free product lasts longer when exposure to the elements (i.e. air, humidity, sunlight) is kept to a minimum.

Celebrating the height of summer, this limited edition facial mask typically features two of my favourite things: vibrant matcha and aromatic lavender. Kaolin is a mild yet effective clay suitable for all skin types selected for its ability to absorb accumulated oil and dirt from pores without over-drying. Organic AOI matcha is prized as a high quality beverage -- applied to skin, it promotes cellular regeneration and decreases sebum production making it beneficial to all skin types, particularly when weather is hot and humid. Lavender also stimulates cellular regeneration while offering mild antibacterial support that leaves skin feeling fresh and clean. Jasmine is softening, mildly exfoliating, and promotes radiance, which is useful for all skin types, but especially great any time skin feels dull or dry and needs a boost. This product is suitable for most skin types. It contains no essential oils, but does include a large quantity of recently ground lavender and jasmine petals, so it is fragrant and thus potentially not suitable for those allergic to botanical ingredients. This preservative-free product lasts longer when exposure to the elements (i.e. air, humidity, sunlight) is kept to a minimum.

This product works by balancing the pH of freshly washed hair, rather than adding greasy oils to minimize the effects of harsh, chemical detergent-based shampoos. Interestingly, this product doubles as a styling product - when sprayed onto dry hair, it helps to keep flat ironed hair sleek and smooth.

But I had other strict criteria in mind, too. The brand needed to be: plant-based, vegan, certified cruelty-free, labelled with ingredient transparency in mind, independently owned, affordable, open to all genders, and it furthermore needed to *not* make gimmicky claims. Narrowing down beyond that, I purchased and tried oh-so-many products, but I was thrilled to discover something that was only one province away... The Green Beaver Company, based in Hawkesbury, Ontario. All products are Eco-Cert certified, certified vegan and cruelty-free by PETA and The Green Beaver Company has taken Environmental Defence's Just Beautiful pledge. From The Green Beaver Company's website: \"This extra gentle shampoo is formulated with the mildest plant-based cleansers to provide a tear-free, all-natural solution for kids. We used Canadian-grown organic raspberry and cranberry emollients to help retain moisture and leave your children’s hair feeling silky soft.\" Each bottle is 240 ml.

All cliches aside, Winnipeg *does* have a cold climate for a large part of the year, and that means this format is unavailable between mid-October to mid-April at my discretion. Thanks!   Please note: HDPE plastic bottles may be discontinued at any time.  Please note: Aluminum is thin and runs the risk of being dented either when shipped from the distributor to me, in the lab during production, or during shipping as a finished product. A dent in aluminum packaging is - at most - an aesthetic inconvenience in that it does not affect the quality or function of the product inside. The same is true for a beverage container - a dent that has not contributed to a leak does not impact the the product, which can still be consumed and enjoyed. Dents are therefore not considered product defects.

            "main_description": "Just the Goods' vegan mouthwash has fast become a favourite, and hopefully you'll love it, too! Apart from the obvious highlights that this products contains no artificial colour/flavour, no sweeteners, no alcohol, no artificial preservatives, and no fluoride, let's take a look at what it does include and why.... Aloe vera gel juice is a natural anti-fungal and antibacterial, so it helps protect sensitive tissue in the mouth by controlling harmful bacteria, which furthermore assists in the fight against tooth decay. Aloe vera gel juice is also said to assist the body in the creation of collagen, which can help to strengthen weak and swollen gums. Alcohol-free witch hazel is known to help reduce pain and swelling, so it is beneficial for irritated or infected gums. Baking soda can be too abrasive for daily tooth brushing, but included as part of a rinse, it can help to control bad breath, discourage plaque, and assist in the healing of gums or other sores. This mouthwash also includes three essential oils: clove is commonly used in dental care around the world to disinfect the mouth, control harmful bacteria, and relieve pain; peppermint controls bacteria while also providing a pleasant taste and delivering fresh breath; myrrh encourages healthy tissue in that it can heal gums and some mouth ulcers. This item is available in 235 ml / 8 oz HDPE bottles or glass bottles (when the weather is warm enough to ensure the product won't freeze and shatter the glass).  This preservative-free product lasts longer when exposure to the elements (i.e. air, humidity, sunlight) is kept to a minimum. Please store in a cool, dark place and keep tightly sealed between uses.",

            "main_description": "Feel good about using this body butter as all day-moisturizer because it is packed with naturally beneficial oils with no extras: no artificial colours or fragrances, preservatives, emulsifiers, or stabilizers. Cocoa butter is rich in vitamin E and is thus said to help prevent and/or treat stretch marks and scars, as well as soothing skin that is irritated and/or sunburned. Those with dry eczema and psoriasis may benefit from this, as well. In addition to a high vitamin content, cocoa butter also contains a great deal of flavonols, which are very strong antioxidants.  And, much like chocolate itself, the smell of cocoa butter often contributes to reducing stress related tension. Grape seed oil helps damaged and stressed tissues because it possesses regenerative and restructuring qualities. Apricot kernel oil, commonly found in baby products, contains vitamins A, C &amp; E. It quickly absorbs into skin and helps to calm the inflammation and/or irritation of eczema and dermatitis. Apricot kernel oil also has a great shelf life when kept out of direct sunlight. Finally, a little bit of tapioca starch helps the product glide on without feeling greasy. This product is handcrafted without the use of artificial preservatives and lasts longer when exposure to the elements (i.e. air, humidity, sunlight) is kept to a minimum.

A mild, moisturizing soap infused with the cleansing and healing benefits of essential oils is a fantastic way to achieve softer, smoother skin without irritation. Just the Good's vegan shaving soap gives a satisfying, clean shave that helps skin feel great thanks to vegetable-derived stearic acid and kaolin for slip and lather, essential oils that disinfect and provide antibacterial support, and shea butter moisturizes. Please note that those with highly sensitive skin and/or an allergy to botanicals may prefer the unscented version of this product.",

            "Directions": "Shaving soaps are quite different than conventional shaving cream in a can.  As you know, cans use aerosol or other expellants to fill a petroleum base with gas and/or air to create a mousse. Just the Goods shaving solids, however, are made without sodium lauryl sulfate or other artificial foaming agents, so the trick to making them work is to use a shaving brush to create tiny bubbles. Brushes are sold separately.  To create lather, first saturate your brush with warm water then swirl it onto the shaving soap in fast and hard circles until tiny bubbles form. Next, using the brush, scoop up the bubbles and transfer them onto the area you wish to shave. A little goes a long way, so even the appearance of what is required is different than conventional shaving foam — all you need is a thin layer to help your razor glide.  Please note that if you try to rub the shaving soap directly onto the desired area, you won’t get enough bubbles to reduce the friction of your razor across your skin. A shaving brush is therefore required to whip up the soap, introducing air into the mixture, and creating the bubbles needed to do the job well.  When you’re finished shaving, tighten the lid of the the jar to prevent the soap from drying out and shrinking. The brush should be rinsed out and, ideally, hung upside down so water doesn’t sit in the base, which may case the adhesive holding the bristles in place to deteriorate. A clean, dry brush also means less bacterial growth, which means a fresher, healthier shave.",

            "Format": "Each perfume vial is 7 ml/ 0.23 fl oz. Second photo shows three vials (with old labels) in a gift set, available on this website in a separate listing.  These vials are small enough that the perfume can be applied to skin by applying it to your fingertip then skin as desired -- ensure hands are washed clean before use to avoid cross-contamination within the bottle leading to premature spoilage.    Perfume in roller-ball bottles are no longer available; I offered that format for several years, then suddenly found that the bottles were leaking during shipment. I contacted the packaging supplier and they had no helpful solution, other than to recommending each bottle be taped before shipping, which I ultimately decided was unattractive and time consuming, and thus unfeasible. ",
            "Note": "What's the difference between perfume and aromatherapeutic oils?   Aromatherapeutic oils are blended with emotionally supportive values in mind (i.e. \"uplifiting\" is can help to lift state of mind; \"safety net\" is comforting/reassuring, etc) whereas the perfume oils are blended with consideration for scent only so ther are not necessarily a unified aromatherapeutic benefit avaialble from the essential oils involved. "

            "main_description": "Feel good about using this body butter as all day-moisturizer because it is packed with naturally beneficial oils with no extras: no artificial colours or fragrances, preservatives, emulsifiers, or stabilizers. Shea butter nourishes skin with vitamins A, E and F to keep it clear and healthy and provide relief to damage caused by over exposure to the sun. Most significantly, shea easily penetrates skin while allowing it to breathe because it doesn’t clog pores. Keep in mind that shea is a nut, so if you prefer to reduce exposure to nuts, we also offer a cocoa-based body butter. Grape seed oil helps damaged and stressed tissues because it possesses regenerative and restructuring qualities. Apricot kernel oil, commonly found in baby products, contains vitamins A, C &amp; E. It quickly absorbs into skin and helps to calm the inflammation and/or irritation of eczema and dermatitis. Apricot kernel oil also has a great shelf life when kept out of direct sunlight. A little bit of tapioca starch helps the product glide on without leaving a greasy residue <a href=\"http://justthegoods.myshopify.com/products/vegan-body-butter\">Scented versions of this body butter are available here.</a>   <a href=\"http://justthegoods.net/products/unscented-nut-free-vegan-body-butter\">Nut-free body butter is available here.</a> This preservative-free product lasts longer when exposure to the elements (i.e. air, humidity, sunlight) is kept to a minimum.

            "main_description": "Ingredient highlights: Avocado oil is rich in vitamins A, D and E, as well as potassium, proteins, beta-carotene and numerous essential unsaturated fatty acids. It also contains a high quantity of sterolins, which is reported to help reduce age spots, help heal sun damage and scars. Avocado oil is furthermore said to increase the amount of collagen in the skin, which facilitates regeneration, particularly in the case of skin that is dehydrated or otherwise affected by difficult climates (i.e. Winnipeg’s dry winters). Some claim that avocado oil can even help to relieve the dryness and itching of psoriasis and eczema. Apricot kernel oil has a high content of vitamins A, C, and E, as well as fatty acids such as oleic and linoleic acid. It is considered gentle enough to be used in products for babies, and is thus also suitable for mature and sensitive skin. It is well absorbed without leaving a greasy feeling, and can be helpful in calming the discomfort associated with conditions such as eczema and dermatitis. Aloe vera gel is a powerful moisturizer that simultaneously helps to remove dead skin. It also stimulates the synthesis of collagen and elastin and is known to have a healing effect on burns and other wounds, all of which translates into assisting regeneration. Distilled water gives this lotion a smooth, fluid texture while ensuring a non-greasy finish, vegetable based emulsifying wax holds everything together, and vegetable glycerine provides staying power. This product is handcrafted without the use of artificial preservatives. Please store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight for maximum longevity. *** As noted above, this item involves the same formula used in the facial moisturizer for normal/sensitive skin, tattoo after care, hair smoothing lotion and as a general hand/body lotion that may benefit those with mild cases of eczema. These items are bottled with different names to better serve those looking for particular items. Customer feedback has also indicated that it helps to avoid confusion with the other facial moisturizers, which include a range of additional ingredients. ***  ",

All cliches aside, Winnipeg *does* have a cold climate for a large part of the year, and that means this format is unavailable between mid-October to mid-April at my discretion. Thanks!    Please note: HDPE plastic bottles may be discontinued at any time.    Please note: Aluminum is thin and runs the risk of being dented either when shipped from the distributor to me, in the lab during production, or during shipping as a finished product. A dent in aluminum packaging is - at most - an aesthetic inconvenience in that it does not affect the quality or function of the product inside. The same is true for a beverage container - a dent that has not contributed to a leak does not impact the the product, which can still be consumed and enjoyed. Dents are therefore not considered product defects.

Please store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight for maximum longevity. *** As noted above, this item involves the same formula used in the facial moisturizer for normal/sensitive skin, tattoo after care, after sun lotion, and as a general hand/body lotion that may benefit those with mild cases of eczema. These items are bottled with different names to better serve those looking for particular items. Customer feedback has also indicated that it helps to avoid confusion with the other facial moisturizers, which include a range of additional ingredients. ***",

            "Note": "During the peak of Covid-19, the cosmetic grade grape seed oil that I usually buy for JTG's hand/body lotion was sold out, so I purchased a significantly more expensive variety to ensure I didn't run out of the material I'd need to fill product demand. This higher grade oil is darker in colour -- much like extra virgin olive oil is darker compared to oil derived from a second or third pressing. So, whereas JTG's hand/body lotion was previously white with a green undertone, the current lotion is pale green. In fairness to clients I have not increased the price of this product, despite it currently being more expensive to make due to the different raw material being used. However, since it looks different and I want folks to be aware of why 🙂   This darker colour has no negative impact on the quality of the product; it will not make your skin green. If anything, this material is more nutrient rich and I wish I could always use it while still delivering JTG's deliberately affordable price points! Please also note that variations in colour in natural products made from agricultural bounty are completely normal and you can find more about this if you scroll through older Instagram posts."

Just the Goods is thrilled to offer an effective liquid roll-on deodorant that is completely free of parabens, propylene glycol, and other suspicious ingredients found even in brands that declare themselves “natural”. Just the Goods’ deodorant works because potassium alum (<a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/705178/POTASSIUM_ALUM/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">which scores a ranking of “1″ on EWG’s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database</a>) and palma rosa essential oil control odour while castor oil and a blend of gluconolactone and sodium benzoate offer anti-bacterial support. Additional essential oils, where applicable, add a variety of fragrance that blends well with natural body chemistry and is never too strong or overpowering. Due to the natural fragrance of palma rosa essential oil — a leaf with a lightly herbal scent — Just the Good’s “basic” variety isn’t unscented. Beyond this, however, three fragrance varieties are offered: basic (light herbal scent); cedar; lavender; citrus blend (sweet orange, lemon, lime, and lemongrass essential oil (not recommended for sensitive skin) Please note that the sample size format is currently only available in “basic”. It should also be noted that the mini roll-on bottle, normally used for perfume oil, can be a little tricky to apply to underarms since it was not designed for that purpose. To use, shake the bottle well and raise arm high allowing the bottle to be completely up-side down while applying. This ensures the deodorant can cover the roller ball fully and apply evenly.  This mini bottle can be refilled just like the regular sized 50 ml bottle. This product is handcrafted without the use of artificial preservatives and lasts longer when exposure to the elements (i.e. air, humidity, sunlight) is kept to a minimum. Please store in a cool, dark place and keep tightly sealed between uses for maximum longevity.",

            "main_description": "Feel good about using this body butter as all day-moisturizer because it is packed with naturally beneficial oils with no extras: no artificial colours or fragrances, preservatives, emulsifiers, or stabilizers. Shea butter nourishes skin with vitamins A, E and F to keep it clear and healthy and provide relief to damage caused by over exposure to the sun. Most significantly, shea easily penetrates skin while allowing it to breathe because it doesn’t clog pores. Keep in mind that shea is a nut, so if you prefer to reduce exposure to nuts, we also offer a cocoa-based body butter. Grape seed oil helps damaged and stressed tissues because it possesses regenerative and restructuring qualities. Apricot kernel oil, commonly found in baby products, contains vitamins A, C &amp; E. It quickly absorbs into skin and helps to calm the inflammation and/or irritation of eczema and dermatitis. Apricot kernel oil also has a great shelf life when kept out of direct sunlight. A little bit of tapioca starch helps the product glide on without leaving a greasy residue Just the Goods' whipped body butter is available in six EWG VERIFIED™ varieties: Lavender, bergamot, ylang ylang Lemon &amp; coriander Pink grapefruit &amp; black pepper Playful (clove essential oil + vanilla absolute) Spicy nights (cinnamon, ylang ylang, sweet orange) Unscented <a href=\"http://justthegoods.net/products/unscented-nut-free-vegan-body-butter\">Nut-free body butter is available in unscented</a>   Not sure if this item is right for you?

            "main_description": "Designed with facial care for sensitive skin in mind, this nutritive, non-greasy product has become popular as an after sun lotion and for the care and maintenance of new tattoos. Ingredient highlights: Avocado oil is rich in vitamins A, D and E, as well as potassium, proteins, beta-carotene and numerous essential unsaturated fatty acids. It also contains a high quantity of sterolins, which is reported to help reduce age spots, help heal sun damage and scars. Avocado oil is furthermore said to increase the amount of collagen in the skin, which facilitates regeneration, particularly in the case of skin that is dehydrated or otherwise affected by difficult climates (i.e. Winnipeg’s dry winters). Some claim that avocado oil can even help to relieve the dryness and itching of psoriasis and eczema. Apricot kernel oil has a high content of vitamins A, C, and E, as well as fatty acids such as oleic and linoleic acid. It is considered gentle enough to be used in products for babies, and is thus also suitable for mature and sensitive skin. It is well absorbed without leaving a greasy feeling, and can be helpful in calming the discomfort associated with conditions such as eczema and dermatitis. Aloe vera gel is a powerful moisturizer that simultaneously helps to remove dead skin. It also stimulates the synthesis of collagen and elastin and is known to have a healing effect on burns and other wounds, all of which translates into assisting regeneration. Distilled water gives this lotion a smooth, fluid texture while ensuring a non-greasy finish, vegetable based emulsifying wax holds everything together, and vegetable glycerine provides staying power. This product is handcrafted without the use of artificial preservatives. Please store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight for maximum longevity. *** As noted above, this item involves the same formula used in the facial moisturizer for normal/sensitive skin, tattoo after care, hair smoothing lotion and as a general hand/body lotion that may benefit those with mild cases of eczema. These items are bottled with different names to better serve those looking for particular items. Customer feedback has also indicated that it helps to avoid confusion with the other facial moisturizers, which include a range of additional ingredients. ***  ",

Please note: HDPE plastic bottles may be discontinued at any time.    Please note: Aluminum is thin and runs the risk of being dented either when shipped from the distributor to me, in the lab during production, or during shipping as a finished product. A dent in aluminum packaging is - at most - an aesthetic inconvenience in that it does not affect the quality or function of the product inside. The same is true for a beverage container - a dent that has not contributed to a leak does not impact the the product, which can still be consumed and enjoyed.

Petroleum is problematic enough without a whole bunch of other chemicals such as parabens and carbomers, not to mention artificial fragrances and colour. Yet, sadly, those elements constitute the basis of most widely available products. It seems the sky is the limit when it comes to selecting oils for use in cosmetics, so our goal when creating a moisturizing lotion was to balance healthier choices and affordability.  Ingredient highlights: Avocado oil is rich in vitamins A, D and E, as well as potassium, proteins, beta-carotene and numerous essential unsaturated fatty acids. It also contains a high quantity of sterolins, which is reported to help reduce age spots, help heal sun damage and scars. Avocado oil is furthermore said to increase the amount of collagen in the skin, which facilitates regeneration, particularly in the case of skin that is dehydrated or otherwise affected by difficult climates (i.e. Winnipeg’s dry winters). Some claim that avocado oil can even help to relieve the dryness and itching of psoriasis and eczema.  Apricot kernel oil has a high content of vitamins A, C, and E, as well as fatty acids such as oleic and linoleic acid. It is considered gentle enough to be used in products for babies, and is thus also suitable for mature and sensitive skin. It is well absorbed without leaving a greasy feeling, and can be helpful in calming the discomfort associated with conditions such as eczema and dermatitis. Aloe vera gel is a powerful moisturizer that simultaneously helps to remove dead skin. It also stimulates the synthesis of collagen and elastin and is known to have a healing effect on burns and other wounds, all of which translates into assisting regeneration.  Lemon myrtle and lavender essential oil provide substantial yet gentle antibacterial support to help pores stay clean, which helps to reduce occasional breakouts.  Distilled water gives this lotion a smooth, fluid texture while ensuring a non-greasy finish, vegetable based emulsifying wax holds everything together, and vegetable glycerine provides staying power.

            "main_description": "A quick look at the ingredients in conventional moisturizing lotion can be disconcerting. Petroleum is problematic enough without a whole bunch of other chemicals such as parabens and carbomers, not to mention artificial fragrances and colour. Yet, sadly, those elements constitute the basis of most widely available products. It seems the sky is the limit when it comes to selecting oils for use in cosmetics, so our goal when creating a moisturizing lotion was to balance healthier choices and affordability.  Ingredient highlights: Avocado oil is rich in vitamins A, D and E, as well as potassium, proteins, beta-carotene and numerous essential unsaturated fatty acids. It also contains a high quantity of sterolins, which is reported to help reduce age spots, help heal sun damage and scars. Avocado oil is furthermore said to increase the amount of collagen in the skin, which facilitates regeneration, particularly in the case of skin that is dehydrated or otherwise affected by difficult climates. Some claim that avocado oil can even help to relieve the dryness and itching of psoriasis and eczema. Apricot kernel oil has a high content of vitamins A, C, and E, as well as fatty acids such as oleic and linoleic acid. It is considered gentle enough to be used in products for babies, and is thus also suitable for mature and sensitive skin. It is well absorbed without leaving a greasy feeling, and can be helpful in calming the discomfort associated with conditions such as eczema and dermatitis. Aloe vera gel is a powerful moisturizer that simultaneously helps to remove dead skin. It also stimulates the synthesis of collagen and elastin and is known to have a healing effect on burns and other wounds, all of which translates into assisting regeneration. Tea tree oil helps fight bacteria and keep pores clear. Distilled water gives this lotion a smooth, fluid texture while ensuring a non-greasy finish, vegetable based emulsifying wax holds everything together, and vegetable glycerine provides staying power. With all this being said, toner is arguably the most important step in preventing occasional acne, and should be used after washing / before applying moisturizer. Additional skin care suggestions, including the most effective way to use toner, can be found here: <a href=\"http://shop.justthegoods.net/?page_id=4126\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://shop.justthegoods.net/?page_id=4126</a>.

            "main_description": "Over the past few years I've developed a more gracious appreciation for sleep. It is no longer something my mind is forced to tolerate from time to time so my body can get back to work. Rather, I've come to understand sleep as an important ritual to reconnect my body and mind so both can process information gained each day and unify  how I perceive experience over time. I embrace with an understanding  that sleep provides essential restorative time for e ach and every cell of the body, and insofar as sleep may be key in shaping memory, and/or drawing forth creative thinking and/or problem solving in the shape of dreams.  Over a year ago I encountered three handmade metal boxes, each stamped with an intricate tree of life, which is an image shared by many cultures worldwide and represents themes such as longevity, prosperity, renewal, peace, and interconnectivity. It took all this time to think of the best way to fill them with loving, supportive intention before moving them forward on their journey out into the world.  Each box contains four herbal blends --- bath salts, tea, aromatherapeutic oil, and incense -- plus a gemstone (and a charcoal disc with which to burn the incense)  thereby offering different routes into restfulness and/or the desire to better connect with your imagination while you rest. They may be used together, but they will likely be more effective if used individually to mitigate potential sensory over-stimulation.  Relaxing Bath Salts: Epsom salt relieves muscle tension Dried marjoram leaf and marjoram essential oil diluted in skin softening fractionated coconut oil soothes emotions to provide gentle relief from sadness, tension, and anxiety to support sleep Chamomile petals reduces inflammation and helps soothe nerves   Sleepy Time Tea: In addition to reducing inflammation and helping to soothe nerves, chamomile can also ease an upset tummy, which is a common cause of sleeplessness Hops has a long history of being used to help improve sleep because it is a natural sedative capable of helping to increase sleep time. Part of this is its ability to help lower body temperature, an important physiological step toward sleep Passionflower is known to help relieve anxiety and insomnia by boosting the level of gamma-aminobutyric acid in the brain, which lowers brain activity to promote relaxation and sleep Rose helps to soothe emotions and promote relaxation Soothing Sleep Aromatherapeutic Oil: Ho wood is high in calming linalool and helps to promote a peaceful and relaxing state of mind Roman chamomile reduces inflammation and helps soothe nerves Petitgrain is a gentle natural sedative Benzoin can promote a sense of peace to facilitate sleep Helichrysum is commonly used to fight insomnia sweet albanian lavender essential oil soothes nervous exhaustion and restlessness Lucid Dreaming Incense: Lavender petals have a calming scent which makes it an excellent tonic for anxiety issues. The aroma removes nervous exhaustion and restlessness while also increasing mental activity in preparation for conscious dreams. Mugwort leaf serves to both physically relax your body while stimulating your mind to alertness Labdanum resin reduces stress to inspire a calm, clear state of mind making it great for any meditative work Amethyst Keeping a piece of softly coloured amethyst at your bedside table can serve as mnemonic encouragement you to let negative thoughts go as you clear your mind in preparation for rest - mindfully gazing at its lines, texture, and shimmer then close your eyes and imagine that soft purple light filling your mind as you drift into dreamland.   Please note, these creations are designed to provide emotional and physical comfort in the context of self-care ritual; they are not designed to treat disease or illness. Please also note, these products are not recommended for use during pregnancy or nursing, nor are they recommended for use by children. Please consult your health care provider if you have any concerns about the suitability of these ingredients with respect to your individual health circumstances. Likewise, if you experience persistent sleeplessness, or sleep that does not leave you feeling refreshed, please consult your healthcare provider.",

Do not light the incense directly -- it needs to smolder, not burn.   How to use a charcoal disc: Fill a heat-proof dish with sand, then place the charcoal disc on top of the sand in the center of the bowl. Strike a match and touch the flame to the disc -- never hold the disc in your hand while lighting. As soon as the disc begins to spark, remove your hand from proximity and allow the disc to ignite. When the sparking stops and the whole disc is burning without a flame, use tongs to drop a piece of incense onto the center of the disc. Add more incense as desired as charcoal can be used until it has been fully burned. Additional incense discs can be found wherever loose incense is sold (i.e. apothecaries, metaphysical boutiques)   Metal box is 5\" x 7\""

            "main_description": "No es fuego, es capitalismo. It is not fire, it's capitalism. The Amazon rainforest is the lungs of the Earth and it is currently being destroyed by massive agricultural corporations who refuse to acknowledge Brazilian court rulings in favour of the Indigenous communities who live there. These corporations have committed arson to deforest land largely for cattle ranching to meet the demand of global fast food chains. The Brazilian government has already expressed hatred for Indigenous communities, and support for unsustainable business, so it is doing absolutely nothing to stop the destruction. The circumstances are both genocide and environmental catastrophe. With enough global pressure (i.e. boycott and divestment), the fires may be stopped. And, in the meantime, displaced communities need access to resources to protect themselves and their remaining land, and restore land, as quickly as possible.  100% of the selling price of this herbal blend made from carefully farmed and/or harvested leaves, flowers, and berries from the Boreal Forest region will be donated to Amazon Watch, a non-profit organization with a 20 year history of fighting the destruction of the Amazon by advancing Indigenous solutions for care of the land to support climate justice for all.  Read more about their work here: <a href=\"https://amazonwatch.org/work\">https://amazonwatch.org/work</a> This herbal blend can be used as either a toner for most skin types, or a hair rinse for most hair types, although folks with chemically lightened hair are encouraged to strand test to determine suitability. Please note that this product may not be suitable for use during pregnancy/nursing - consult your health care provider for details.   The properties/benefits of each selected ingredient are as follows: Linden helps the skin fight inflammation and infections to soothe irritation and reduce puffiness, while its antioxidant properties mitigate the impact of environmental stress. It is also known to help cleanse the scalp, alleviate irritation, and promote circulation to stimulate hair growth. Hyssop is a powerhouse plant! It's antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties make it capable of caring for wounds such as frostbite and/or rashes caused by infections, while its cicatrisant properties helps skin heal from damage without scarring. On a more day-to-day basis, it can help to clean skin, minimize excess sebum, reduce enlarged pores and create a soft, smooth complexion. In hair care it can help to manage scalp conditions for healthier hair. Nettle is rich in phytonutrients, minerals, and antioxidants to promote clear skin and a healthy scalp with better cellular longevity. It is also said to have a stimulating effect by promoting circulation for better hair growth, as well as depositing pantothenic acid and silica to strengthen hair. Juniper berries are astringent, antimicrobial, and antifungal making them useful in toning skin and reducing the appearance of blemishes and/or eczema. In hair care it can help to strengthen hair, cleanse the scalp, restore a helpful balance of oil, and combat dandruff Cedar leaf oil can be used to care for a variety of skin issues ranging from acne to eczema to psoriasis to warts thanks to its reparative and astringent properties, and ability to minimize scars. The effects of cedar leaf are not as strong when brewed as tea, but it can still play a supportive role in overall health. Cedar has also been known to stimulate new hair growth and help to repair damaged hair follicles and shafts.

            "Directions": "For facial toner: steep approximately 1 tbsp of dried herbal blend in a teapot or bowl with approximately 1/2 cup of boiling water for 10 minutes. Strain tea and pour it into a heatsafe bottle or jar to cool. When it is completely cool, after washing and drying your face, apply tea to skin with a cotton round as you would any other toner (tips on how to use toner most effectively can be found here <a href=\"https://justthegoods.net/pages/tips-for-daily-skin-care\">https://justthegoods.net/pages/tips-for-daily-skin-care</a>). Store remaining toner well sealed in your refrigerator for up to 5 days.     For hair rinse: steep tea as above and allow it to cool. Then, after shampooing, pour over hair in a method of your choosing to maximize contact with scalp and length of hair. Some people like to hold the length of their hair in the bowl of rinse for a few minutes, then pour the remaining amount over their scalp. Allow rinse to absorb into hair and scalp for 3 - 5 minutes before rinsing with water and styling as usual.     ",

            "main_description": "Just the Goods recently hosted a Herbal Bath Oil Bar at Generation Green in the Exchange, which involved inviting participants to create their very own herbal bath oil by adding any combination of available dried botanicals and essential oils. It was so much fun! So, in the spirit of making it available to others, I think I've figured out how to enjoy this option online as a limited edition item. Each 235 ml / 8 fl oz bottle can be used for between 4 - 6 baths, depending on the amount of oil and fragrance you enjoy.  And, if you don't have a bathtub, a herbal oil can make a wonderful foot soak on its own, or as a first stage in an at home pedicure.  The base for this bath oil is a  blend of apricot kernel oil (prunus armeniaca) and fractionated coconut oil (caprylic/capric triglyceride).  Light and gentle apricot kernel oil is easily absorbed into the skin without leaving any oily residue. High in vitamins E, A and K, as well as omega 6 fatty acids, it can deeply penetrate skin to moisturize and nourish all skin types. So nourishing, in fact, it’s anti-inflammatory benefits can even help to soothe eczema. Coconut oil contains saturated fats in the form of medium chain fatty acids or triglycerides which helps skin retain moisture for smooth elasticity and softness while reducing the size of pores. It also contains capric/caprylic/lauric acid which are in some ways similar to medium chain fatty acids but have considerable disinfectant and antimicrobial properties to help prevent and/or treat infections. Step 1: Choose up to three tablespoons of any of the following dried botanicals. If you prefer to use only one botanical, choose the same herb three times... Calendula (c alendula officinalis) has been used for centuries to treat minor wounds, stings, rashes and skin irritations such as chafing and dryness due to being high in carotenoids, which are are antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and immune stimulating. Gentle enough for use by people of all ages. Although rare, there are cases of allergic reaction. Calendula can stimulate menstruation so it should not be used internally during pregnancy. Chamomile (a nthemis nobilis) blossoms contain bisabolol, which is responsible for its anti-irritant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-microbial properties. In a bath it can offer gentle cleansing while also soothing and softening dry, irritated skin and some rashes. It's calming fragrance can soothe nerves to reduce headaches and/or promote sleep. Cornflower (c entraurea cyanus) petals are rich in essential minerals salt such as calcium and potassium. Compounds such as anthocyanins, flavonoids, and tannins make them antioxidant, astringent, antiseptic, soothing, and anti-inflammatory. In baths fresh or dried cornflower can ease joint and muscle stiffness and soothes irritated skin while softening skin. As a tea it can soothe the nervous system and reduce anxiety. Jasmine (j asminum officinale) has been studied extensively for its ability to reduce depression and anxiety while increasing focus by calming nerve activity and gently decreasing heart rate. Rich in flavonoid antioxidants that combat oxidative stress, jasmine tea is a mild sedative that relaxes the body and mind. It's antispasmodic properties make it an effective aid for muscle pain, stiffness, and sprains and has been used in some cultures for pain-relief during childbirth. Jasmine can help to increase the elasticity of skin and balance moisture to naturally reduce dryness. Jasmine is gentle enough to be used by all, but in rare cases may trigger allergic reaction. Lavender (l avandula angustifolia) offers anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and antibacterial properties which support acne prone and eczemic skin by boosting circulation, decongesting, and ultimately allowing for better moisturization to improve cellular renewal and thus healing. Aromatherapeutically, it can induce relaxation by soothing nerves. Lavender can be used by almost all people; however, since it has been found to slow the central nervous system it should not be used in combination with anesthesia and other medications during or after surgery. Avoid use for a few weeks prior to scheduled surgery. Rose (r osa centifolia) has been used in baths for a soothing perfumed effect for centuries . In skin care, rose helps to replenish and soften. Its anti-inflammatory properties help reduce redness or swelling, while mild antibacterial benefits cleanse and tone. High in vitamin C, rose petals are thus antioxidant and can help prevent cellular damage.     Rosemary (r osmarinus officinalis) contains the phenolic anti-oxidant rosmarinic acid, as well other valuable compound that offer rubefacient (counterirritant), anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, anti-fungal and anti-septic properties. It delivers a deep clean that manages excessive oil. Aromatherapically, it stimulates without being overly energetic making it helpful for focus and concentration. Rosemary should be used with caution during pregnancy, by those with kidney issues, and neurological conditions such as epilepsy. Step 2: Choose up to two essential oils. If you prefer to include only one essential oil, please select the same oil twice; choose \"none\" if you prefer your herbal bath oil without any essential oils added at all.  Cedarwood (juniperus virginiana): soothes the senses and helps prevent the growth of fungus Grapefruit  (citrus paradisi): antidepressant, disinfectant, lymphatic stimulant. It may cause photosensitization, so avoid applying before going out into sunlight for prolonged periods Lavender (lavandula angustifolia): soothing, anti-depressant, sedative (Avoid use before surgery) Orange (citrus sinensis): antiseptic, anti-depressant, anti-inflammatory, sedative. It may cause photosensitization, so avoid applying before going out into sunlight for prolonged periods Patchouli (pogostemon cablin): antidepressant, aphrodisiac, sedative Rosemary (r osmarinus officinalis) : antidepressant, astringent, stimulant; beneficial to oily and acne prone skin, restores glow to dull skin (not safe for use by those prone to epileptic seizure) Ylang ylang (rananga odorata): anti-depressant, aphrodisiac, moisturizing, sedative (Excessive use may cause headache) None : a bath oil without essential oils is an ideal option for use during pregnancy/nursing, or in the case of sensitivity/allergy to essential oils  ",

            "main_description": "A few weeks ago I mentioned via Instagram that my friends and I are using a series of new moon meditations to explore each chakra beginning with the root chakra, muladhara. I brought with me an aromatherapeutic perfume oil and herbal tea blended specifically to help us better sense this chakra within our bodies and it was an enjoyable experience, so I did it again when we got to the second chakra; however, this time it was so much enjoyed that one person said: \"Oh wow! This is amazing! You should make more of these and sell them!\" ... and so, here we are ;-) Svadhisthana, the sacral chakra, is associated with the emotional body, sensuality, creativity, relationships, and connection to our inner and outer worlds. Translated from sanskrit, Svadhisthana means “your own place”. Its element is water so its energy is characterized by flow and flexibility and it is directed by the principle of pleasure.  It is understood that all chakras need to be balanced in order to promote wellbeing, but I feel spending time thinking about the sacral chakra stood out for us because our lives are always so busy and we rarely make time to \"stop and smell the roses\". Directing attention to the sacral chakra is a reminder that it's important to enjoy life.  ... The oils in this perfume are ones are all grounding, earthy, warm and romantic -- ylang ylang, sandalwood, patchouli, and rose -- with a pop of bright energy in the form of sweet orange. ...  The herbal tea features soothing calendula, enlivening orange peel, uplifting vanilla bean powder, and sensual damiana which combine to create an energy that is soft, sweet and loving. ...  The sacral chakra is believed to be connected to the moon, so moonstone is said to be capable of bringing both opening and soothing benefits to the body and mind. I've selected pieces that contain warmer peachy orange tones, further associating it with the colour of the second chaka Each set includes on 2 dram bottle of perfume oil, one sachet of loose leaf tea, and one carefully selected piece of moonstone packed in a silver organza bag ready for gift giving, or to be unwrapped as a gift to yourself. Please note:  Damiana may not be suitable for use during pregnancy/nursing.

That night I mixed one part of one each and let this new blend infuse into cold water overnight for use a hair rinse the next morning. The results were fantastic, and gave me a tangible example of herbal balance in action. This blend features:  Slippery elm - earth - detangles while promoting smooth texture and shine Lavender - air - contributes volume Rosemary - fire - stimulates blood circulation in the scalp, which can contribute to hair growth, while also moisturizing scalp and adding shine Catnip - water - moisturizes and conditions Directions for use can be found below... but i n case you're curious, no, your cat will not likely be attracted to this blend because the catnip is mixed with so many other things.

            "main_description": "Last year, to support the valiant efforts of the Water Protectors at Standing Rock, Just The Goods and The Granola Goat created Forest Spirit, a special and limited edition face mask combining the herbal and cultural value of yarrow and cedar. Water is life and we acknowledge that the struggle continues to protect all living creatures relying on fresh, clean water for survival. This is an important time of transition and allyship is needed as much now as ever. Today we're re-launching this limited edition item in support of Kwekwecnewtxw and related Indigenous-led opposition to Kinder Morgan. All funds raised will go toward building and sustaining frontline resistance grounded in Coast Salish spirituality and culture to stop the Kinder Morgan tar sands pipeline. To donate directly, please visit http://www.protecttheinlet.ca.  #ProtectTheInlet On March 10, 2018 thousands marched to #ProtectTheInlet and witnessed the construction of Kwekwecnewtxw, which translates to “a place to watch from.” A Watch House is a traditional structure of the Coast Salish people that’s been used for tens of thousands of years to watch for enemies on their territories. The Watch House will be occupied by Coast Salish members, and used for ceremony and Indigenous gathering. Kwekwecnewtxw is organized by Coast Salish members and supported by a range of allies including: Stand.Earth, 350.org, Greenpeace Canada, the Sea Wolves and more. Tsleil-Waututh members are involved, but not the Tsleil-Waututh Nation government or its Chief and Council. Kwekwecnewtxw will be an ongoing action. Details about next steps will be communicated to everyone who wishes to be informed. Text \"READY\" to 52267 and/or visit www.protecttheinlet.ca for more information.  Kwekwecnewtxw is pronounced Kwu-kwe-ow-tukh. Yarrow Micmac people, as well as ancient Greeks, regard yarrow for its ability to treat sprains by reducing bruising and swelling. In China, it is used to brighten the eyes and promote intelligence. Ancient Roman tradition believes yarrow is ruled by Venus and the element of water. Throughout Europe, yarrow continues to drive away negativity and represent love. The Navajo people consider it a sacred Life Medicine and Anishinaabe people value it for purification. The Teton Lakota people call yarrow “medicine for the wounded.” In the Victorian language of flowers, yarrow represents both war and healing. From the perspective of herbal medicine, it is known worldwide to rid the body of toxins through the provision of anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, astringent and tonic benefits, and it can soothe irritated skin. Cedar In many cultures worldwide spanning from Cherokee to Ojibwe to Druids to Norse, cedar is connected with ancestors so it is used to drive away negative influences, cleanse, heal, and protect. It can also promote confidence and strength. From a skincare perspective, cedarwood essential oil it is an astringent and can reduce irritation through anti-inflammatory and antiseptic benefits, making it a positive complement to yarrow, and a wonderful choice for oily or problem skin.   Forest Spirit In a base of kaolin clay, this mask is soothing, clarifying, and exfoliating.  Please note: Prolonged use of yarrow may promote photo-sensitivity and, in some cases, those allergic to ragweed may find a similar response to yarrow**. As such this mask is recommended for most skin types, but may not be suitable for those with highly sensitive skin or allergies to botanical ingredients. Although this mask does not contain nanoparticles, care should still be used to not inhale dust while preparing. This mask is not recommended for use during pregnancy/nursing. This preservative-free product lasts longer when exposure to the elements (i.e. air, humidity, sunlight) is kept to a minimum. Please store in a cool, dark place and keep tightly sealed between uses. *Just the Goods will donate $14.00 CAD per jar of Forest Spirit sold to #protecttheinlet  **Liz and I are both allergic to ragweed pollen but experienced no adverse effects using yarrow/this mask",

            "main_description": "Once I've established a formula, making new batches of it each week easily becomes part of my routine; however, there are a few things I've created for my own use that tend to feel quite personal. This is one case in point – an aromatherapeutic scent to facilitate quiet, generative meditation that helps mark the self-care time I need to manage chronic illness. I don't have a diffuser and sometimes want to be enveloped with scent rather than simply place it on my pulse points, so I created a hair perfume to settle my mind and focus my thinking. I also enjoy how it lingers with me in the most lovely way for several hours later – the initial notes are fresh, spicy, and cardamom forward, which then give way to the soft warmth of sweet vanilla-like benzoin. The base of this perfume is rosewater, which doubles as a gentle conditioner... cuz you know I love those multi-function creations ;-) Each element in this hair perfume was selected according to their aromatherapeutic values: Geranium and lavender are centring Cardamom is centring and focusing  Rosewater and neroli are both centring and uplifting Beyond this... Vetiver helps us connect to our roots so that we may ground and become present Benzoin is widely regarded as helpful for meditation, but also encourages dreaming  Petitgrain clears the mind while also alleviating emotions such as anger, shock, and fear Each bottle comes in an organza gift bag with 4 carefully selected gemstones to hold or ponder as desired. Shapes and size vary to create a balanced set: Amethyst chevron enhances relaxation to facilitate self-discovery and peace of mind Rose quartz opens the heart, increases self acceptance and the ability to love others Moonstone provides the patience needed for inner work and grows intuition Lapis lazuli clears the mind and is said to be a powerful thought amplifier.

Yule is therefore the perfect time to both indulge in much needed rest and spark new ideas with those closet to you to keep you going through the remaining cold months and to be ready to hop into action when the Earth re-emerges from slumber. The bath salts and lotion to celebrate this season are both fresh, bright, zesty and invigorating like a deep breath of crisp fresh air.  Yule sea salt soak (260 g): Cedar tips bring confidence, strength, protection, healing, and purification Rose petals and rose otto cultivate love and friendship, and promote domestic peace/happiness, and lasting relationships, all of which are especially helpful as we spend more time together indoors White spruce essential oil encourages adaptability, balance, clarity, enlightenment, intuition, and memory Yule hand/body lotion (118 ml): Blood orange inspires creativity and imagination as well as courage and strength. Requiring the cool of the night to develop and ripen, they are a perfect metaphor for the way we ourselves can blossom during the winter months Juniper attracts healthy energies and love. It is also calming and grounding while fostering strength and transformation through learning, harmony and community   These preservative-free products last longer when exposure to the elements (i.e. air, humidity, sunlight) is kept to a minimum.

This is an important time of transition and allyship is needed as much now as ever. #NoDAPL We are donating all proceeds from the sale of Forest Spirit to Sacred Stone Camp knowing they will allocate to the fund with the most need*: <a href=\"http://sacredstonecamp.org/donate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://sacredstonecamp.org/donate/</a>. With the recent approval of Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain and Enbridge's Line 3 expansions in Canada, please note deeper resistance is needed here as well. Please visit Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion's website for more information: <a href=\"http://www.treatyalliance.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.treatyalliance.org/</a>. Yarrow Micmac people, as well as ancient Greeks, regard yarrow for its ability to treat sprains by reducing bruising and swelling. In China, it is used to brighten the eyes and promote intelligence. Ancient Roman tradition believes yarrow is ruled by Venus and the element of water. Throughout Europe, yarrow continues to drive away negativity and represent love. The Navajo people consider it a sacred Life Medicine and Anishinaabe people value it for purification. The Teton Lakota people call yarrow “medicine for the wounded.” In the Victorian language of flowers, yarrow represents both war and healing. From the perspective of herbal medicine, it is known worldwide to rid the body of toxins through the provision of anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, astringent and tonic benefits, and it can soothe irritated skin. Cedar In many cultures worldwide spanning from Cherokee to Ojibwe to Druids to Norse, cedar is connected with ancestors so it is used to drive away negative influences, cleanse, heal, and protect. It can also promote confidence and strength. From a skincare perspective, cedarwood essential oil it is an astringent and can reduce irritation through anti-inflammatory and antiseptic benefits, making it a positive complement to yarrow, and a wonderful choice for oily or problem skin.   Forest Spirit In a base of kaolin clay, this mask is soothing, clarifying, and exfoliating.  Please note: Prolonged use of yarrow may promote photo-sensitivity and, in some cases, those allergic to ragweed may find a similar response to yarrow**. As such this mask is recommended for most skin types, but may not be suitable for those with highly sensitive skin or allergies to botanical ingredients. Although this mask does not contain nanoparticles, care should still be used to not inhale dust while preparing. This mask is not recommended for use during pregnancy/nursing. This preservative-free product lasts longer when exposure to the elements (i.e. air, humidity, sunlight) is kept to a minimum. Please store in a cool, dark place and keep tightly sealed between uses. * Just the Goods will donate $13.25 CAD per jar of Forest Spirit sold. **Liz and I are both allergic to ragweed pollen but experienced no adverse effects using yarrow/this mask",

The number of containers of face mask available each year will be determined based on the available quantity of lavender harvested. Kaolin is a mild yet effective clay suitable for all skin types selected for its ability to absorb accumulated oil and dirt from pores without over-drying. Organic AOI matcha is prized as a high quality beverage -- applied to skin, it promotes cellular regeneration and decreases sebum production making it beneficial to all skin types, particularly when weather is hot and humid. Lavender also stimulates cellular regeneration while offering mild antibacterial support that leaves skin feeling fresh and clean. Jasmine is softening, mildly exfoliating, and promotes radiance, which is useful for all skin types, but especially great any time skin feels dull or dry and needs a boost. This product is suitable for most skin types. It contains no essential oils, but does include a large quantity of recently ground lavender and jasmine petals, so it is fragrant and thus potentially not suitable for those allergic to botanical ingredients. This preservative-free product lasts longer when exposure to the elements (i.e. air, humidity, sunlight) is kept to a minimum.

Designed with facial care for sensitive skin in mind, this nutritive, non-greasy product has become popular for the care and maintenance of new tattoos. Highlighted ingredients: Avocado oil is rich in vitamins A, D and E, as well as potassium, proteins, beta-carotene and numerous essential unsaturated fatty acids. It also contains a high quantity of sterolins, which is reported to help reduce age spots, help heal sun damage and scars. Avocado oil is furthermore said to increase the amount of collagen in the skin, which facilitates regeneration, particularly in the case of skin that is dehydrated or otherwise affected by difficult climates. Some claim that avocado oil can even help to relieve the dryness and itching of psoriasis and eczema. Apricot kernel oil has a high content of vitamins A, C, and E, as well as fatty acids such as oleic and linoleic acid. It is considered gentle enough to be used in products for babies, and is thus also suitable for mature and sensitive skin. It is well absorbed without leaving a greasy feeling, and can be helpful in calming the discomfort associated with conditions such as eczema and dermatitis. Aloe vera gel is a powerful moisturizer that simultaneously helps to remove dead skin. It also stimulates the synthesis of collagen and elastin and is known to have a healing effect on burns and other wounds, all of which translates into assisting regeneration. This product is handcrafted without the use of artificial preservatives. Please store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight for maximum longevity and please use within 6 months of opening. Artist biographies Katakankabin 's veganism is a refusal of animal exploitation. In addition to maintaining a strict vegan diet, she carefully avoids the use of any products and/or activities that contributes to the abuse, pain, or enslavement of other species. This goal means living -- as best as possible -- without reliance on materials such as leather, or attending zoos and/or circuses, etc. Applied to the field of tattooing, pursuing strict veganism involves excluding products containing animal by-products and/or products that have been tested on animals (i.e. inks, disinfectants, soap, lotion). It also involves ensuring the workplace is free of leather and non-vegan drawing materials. Katakankabin's arts-informed radical activism is diverse. In addition to being the author of several political satires, her studies in architecture in Montreal led her to becoming involved in student politics, as well as artistic journalism addressing the West Bank. Her current adventure started when she learned tattooing in Mexico three years ago. She has since worked in Montreal and New York and - now on the road - she books clients in cities worldwide. Find her in Panama (April 9 - 18), Puerto Rico (May 10 - 21), and Brazil (June - July). Katakankabin's work is largely identifiable through her use of abstract and figurative lines.

Urban Earth Teas is proud to offer products that are as good for the earth as they are for the body. All blends are created by Doctor of Natural Medicine, Mara Jones, who has over 15 years of custom tea blending experience. She believes that teas should be as gorgeous as they are good for you. Urban Earth Teas is based in Powell River, British Columbia. Peace is both relaxing and uplifting thanks to a beautiful, floral blend that helps to battle the blues. An examination of the ingredients also reveals that: Chamomile softens skin, reduces puffiness, and gently moisturizes Lemon balm (a.k.a melissa) is anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anti-oxidant Borage heals dry/damaged skin Lavender is mildly antibacterial in ways that are especially beneficial for oily skin, but suitable for use with other skin types Rose gently moisturizes and softens skin Combined, this variety of flowers and herbs does a little of everything to support clean, glowing skin for all skin types. I asked Mara  for her thoughts on using this tea as a herbal facial steam for all skin types and, to my delight, she agreed that it would be a great way to enjoy this blend. This preservative-free product lasts longer when exposure to the elements (i.e. air, humidity, sunlight) is kept to a minimum.

            "main_description": "Razor burn and bumps, as well as itchy and flaking skin, can often be attributed to the harsh and pore clogging petro-chemicals found in conventional shaving cream. A mild, moisturizing soap infused with the cleansing and healing benefits of essential oils is a fantastic way to achieve softer, smoother skin without irritation. Just the Good's vegan shaving soap gives a satisfying, clean shave that helps skin feel great thanks to vegetable-derived stearic acid and kaolin for slip and lather, essential oils that disinfect and provide antibacterial support, and avocado oil and shea butter ensuring rich moisture. Beyond this, avocado oil is known to be regenerative and rejuvenating due to its high quantity of sterolins, which are reputed to reduce age spots and help heal sun damage and scars. In the scented version, lavender and bergamot provide additional benefit in that both oils are antiseptic and lavender is furthermore known as a bactericide while bergamot features antibiotic properties. This combination smells fantastic and both oils are great for lifting spirits and combating depression. While mild, it is still recommended that those with highly sensitive skin and/or an allergy to botanicals opt for the unscented version of this product instead.",
            "Ingredients": "SLS &amp; propylene glycol-free melt &amp; pour base [water, vegetable glycerine, sodium stearate, sodium oleate, sorbitol, stearic acid, lauric acid, sodium laurate, sodium myristate, pentasodium penteate, tetrasodium etidronate] with unrefined butyrospermum parkii (shea butter), persea gratissima (avocado) oil, kaolin clay, tocopherol (vitamin e - contains non gmo soy) + essential oils where applicable",
            "Directions": "Shaving soaps are quite different than conventional shaving cream in a can.  As you know, cans use aerosol or other expellants to fill a petroleum base with gas and/or air to create a mousse. Just the Goods shaving solids, however, are made without sodium lauryl sulfate or other artificial foaming agents, so the trick to making them work is to use a shaving brush to create tiny bubbles. Brushes are sold separately.  To create lather, first saturate your brush with warm water then swirl it onto the shaving soap in fast and hard circles until tiny bubbles form. Next, using the brush, scoop up the bubbles and transfer them onto the area you wish to shave. A little goes a long way, so even the appearance of what is required is different than conventional shaving foam — all you need is a thin layer to help your razor glide.  Please note that if you try to rub the shaving soap directly onto the desired area, you won’t get enough bubbles to reduce the friction of your razor across your skin. A shaving brush is therefore required to whip up the soap, introducing air into the mixture, and creating the bubbles needed to do the job well.  When you’re finished shaving, tighten the lid of the the jar to prevent the soap from drying out and shrinking. The brush should be rinsed out and, ideally, hung upside down so water doesn’t sit in the base, which may case the adhesive holding the bristles in place to deteriorate. A clean, dry brush also means less bacterial growth, which means a fresher, healthier shave.",
            "Format": "Just the Goods shaving solids are poured directly into 125 ml / 4 oz reusable glass canning jars and offer a 65 g / 2.29 oz of soap."

This is why Just the Goods trusts The All Natural Face and is thrilled to share this fantastic mineral makeup find!  Vegan powder mineral eyeshadow by the All Natural Face is richly pigmented for beautiful colour that blends flawlessly. A little goes a long way! But, for all day wear, consider using a priming base to hold your shades in place. A tiny dab of <a href=\"shop.justthegoods.net/?product_tag=facial-moisturizer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Just the Goods facial moisturizer</a> on eyelids is enough to do the trick, but The All Natural Face's very own primer is also an option. Just the Goods does not currently carry this primer; however, it can become option with enough demand.  Vegan powder mineral eyeshadow by the All Natural Face is presented a small acrylic jar with a sifter seal to help prevent spills. Just the Goods carries 2 gram jars.  Ingredients:  mica, magnesium myristate, boron, nitride oxides."

Advantages of soy wax include: Soy wax is all-natural &amp; environmentally friendly as it is not made from petroleum like paraffin wax. Soy candles last 50 % longer than paraffin candles.

Leaves are cleaned from the stems and separated into small pieces to be used in many ways (for making tea, bathing and ceremony). It represents grounding, maturity, purification and balance.

Most commercial daily brush cleaners contain isopropyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, acetone, propylene glycol and/or artificial fragrance to mask the harsh scent of those nasty petrochemicals. Just the Goods’ makeup brush cleanser features the disinfecting benefits of alcohol-free witch hazel and tea tree oil, as well as a small amount of olive oil to gently condition bristles to prevent breakage and/or fluffy stray ends. This preservative-free product lasts longer when exposure to the elements (i.e. air, humidity, sunlight) is kept to a minimum. Please store in a cool, dark place and keep tightly sealed between uses.",

Shake bottle well before spraying brush with cleanser, let soak for one minute, brush against a sheet of paper towel, and repeat until no more makeup transfers to the paper towel. When the brush is clean, gently pat it with a towel to remove excess liquid, then lay it flat on a towel and allow it to dry completely before using it again.",
